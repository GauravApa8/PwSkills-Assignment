Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?     \n","Ans. We use set instead of list in python because Sets don't allow duplicate elements when we want to store data with uniqueness, Sets are optimized for fast membership testing and Sets support various mathematical set operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference. If these operations are required, using a set is more efficient and semantically appropriate."],"metadata":{"id":"HhjBR3AU6osk"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["6. What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?     \n","Ans. A string is a sequence of characters between single or double quotes.

How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?     \n","Ans. Tuples in Python ensure data integrity through their immutability. Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be modified, added, or removed. This characteristic guarantees that the data stored within a tuple remains constant throughout its lifecycle. Immutability makes tuples suitable for scenarios where data consistency is crucial, such as representing fixed records, storing configuration settings, or using them as keys in dictionaries. Any attempt to alter a tuple will result in an error."],"metadata":{"id":"a7HvFEWb8edb"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["8. What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?     \n","Ans. A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs, where each key is unique and mapped to a specific location (index) in an array using a hash function. This allows for efficient retrieval, insertion, and deletion of data. The hash function computes the index based on the key, aiming for even distribution to minimize collisions (multiple keys mapping to the same index).\n","In Python, dictionaries are implemented using hash tables. When a key-value pair is added to a dictionary, Python's built-in hash function calculates the hash value of the key, which determines the index where the value will be stored. This mechanism enables dictionaries to provide average-case O(1) time complexity for common operations like accessing, inserting, and deleting elements, making them highly efficient for various applications."],"metadata":{"id":"aMqS4uj28152"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["9. Can lists contain different data types in Python?     \n","Ans. Yes, lists in Python can contain elements of different data types. Python lists are versatile and do not enforce a strict type constraint on their elements. This means a single list can hold integers, strings, floats, booleans, or even other lists and dictionaries.     \n","Example is given below:"],"metadata":{"id":"TQiNO_db9WHD"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["my_list1 = [1, \"PwSkills\", [1, 2, 4], 4.5, {\"Course\":\"Data Analytics course\", \"Duration\":300}, True, (5, -4, 4+8j)]\n","print(my_list1)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"xKoXEGcN96PW","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1747279584180,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":33,"user":{"displayName":"Gaurav Suman","userId":"08728397763247326606"}},"outputId":"18693881-39c4-42f6-ae4e-b391c4abed93"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["[1, 'PwSkills', [1, 2, 4], 4.5, {'Course': 'Data Analytics course', 'Duration': 300}, True, (5, -4, (4+8j))]\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["10. Explain why strings are immutable in Python.     \n","Ans. Strings are immutable in Python primarily for efficiency and safety reasons. Immutability allows for optimizations such as string interning, where identical string literals are stored only once in memory. If strings were mutable, modifying one instance would unintentionally affect all other references to the same string, leading to unpredictable behavior. Additionally, immutable strings can be used as dictionary keys, as their hash values remain constant throughout their lifetime. This property is crucial for maintaining the integrity of dictionaries, which rely on stable hash values for efficient lookups."],"metadata":{"id":"CVasuw2--sf1"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["11. What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?     \n","Ans. It is more efficient to use dictionaries for the searching of elements as it can be carried out in a much faster manner.

Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list.    \n","Ans. Use a list if you need a mutable collection of items where you may need to add, remove, or change elements.

Use a tuple if you need an immutable collection where the elements won't change after creation."],"metadata":{"id":"DkI61nkKAmi-"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["13. How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?    \n","Ans. In Python, sets are designed to store only unique elements. When a user attempts to add a duplicate value to a set, the set automatically discards the duplicate, ensuring that it contains only distinct elements. This behavior is fundamental to the nature of sets as unordered collections of unique items.   \n","Example is given below:"],"metadata":{"id":"SIKmSuBEA92H"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["my_set = {1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 4, 4}  #here in this set there are many duplicate elemets are there but after using set we can print only unique elements after creating sets.\n","print(my_set)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"a22hS1kwBZ3k","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1747280416044,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":72,"user":{"displayName":"Gaurav Suman","userId":"08728397763247326606"}},"outputId":"c02f5417-3e1a-4f29-ec90-13fc2d9a346e"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["my_set.add(8)\n","print(my_set)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"eCvjzH2YBjio","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1747280441877,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":50,"user":{"displayName":"Gaurav Suman","userId":"08728397763247326606"}},"outputId":"d70243b5-bbdd-469d-8a68-fbacdb44c2cf"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["my_set.add(7)\n","print(my_set) #While using set we can also arrange in sequence manner of elements."],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Dd_1NVPSB7A1","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1747280461904,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":16,"user":{"displayName":"Gaurav Suman","userId":"08728397763247326606"}},"outputId":"b89fbae6-af09-4558-c251-1bed00c0a860"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["14.
