However, Python does not natively support method overloading in the same way as some other languages like Java or C++. Instead, it achieves similar functionality through techniques like default arguments or variable arguments.  \n",
        "When multiple methods with the same name are defined, Python only retains the most recently defined one. This means that directly defining multiple methods with the same name but different signatures will not result in traditional method overloading.  \n",
        "To simulate method overloading, one can use default arguments. By providing default values for some or all of the parameters, a single method can handle different numbers of arguments. Another approach involves using variable arguments (*args and **kwargs), which allows a method to accept an arbitrary number of positional or keyword arguments, respectively. Inside the method, the logic can then be adjusted based on the arguments received."

Method overriding in Python is a feature of object-oriented programming that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. When a method in a subclass has the same name, parameters, and return type as a method in its superclass, the subclass method overrides the superclass method. This means that when the method is called on an object of the subclass, the subclass's version of the method will be executed instead of the superclass's version."

        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?  \n",
        "Ans. Polymorphism in Python, in the context of inheritance, enables objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in a way that is specific to their class. This is primarily achieved through method overriding. When a subclass inherits from a parent class, it can redefine methods of the parent class.  \n",
        "Here's how it works:\n",
        "*   Inheritance: A subclass inherits attributes and methods from a parent class.\n",
        "*   Method Overriding: The subclass provides its own implementation for a method already defined in its parent class.\n",
        "*   Polymorphism: When a method is called on an object, Python determines the correct method implementation to execute based on the object's actual class, not the declared type.\n",

        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?  \n",
        "Ans. Method chaining in Python is a programming technique used in object-oriented programming where multiple methods are called sequentially on the same object in a single statement. This is achieved by having each method return the object itself (usually self), allowing subsequent methods to be called directly on the result. It enhances code readability and conciseness by avoiding the need for intermediate variables."

        "Ans. The __call__ method in Python enables instances of a class to be called like regular functions. When a class implements the __call__ method, it makes its instances \"callable.\" This means you can apply the function call syntax () directly to an object of that class. The __call__ method can take arguments, similar to a regular function."
